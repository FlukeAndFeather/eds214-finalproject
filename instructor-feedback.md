# Exceeds spec

## [] Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

I believe my Quarto doc does run by itself but I also made it super concise and referenced to other folders like `R` folder if the reader would like to learn about the details more.

## [] Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

In relation to the first one, I have one R script called `dataimport_cleaning.R`, in the `R` folder. I felt that keeping it very concise would be best, keeping it separate from all the other R scripts used. This also made it really easy to follow I think.

# Collaboration
1. The feedback went well. I received good feedback telling me my qmd was great but would've liked more constructive stuff. For reviewing a peer, I was able to help them make their qmd more concise and less code-y.
